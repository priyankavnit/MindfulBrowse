# Product Overview

## Digital Wellness Platform

This project is a privacy-first digital wellness platform that helps users understand and improve their relationship with web content consumption. The platform consists of two main features:

### Mindful Browse
A comprehensive digital wellbeing application that analyzes the emotional footprint of daily web usage. It provides users with insights into how their content consumption affects their emotional state through six key metrics: Information Overload, Negative Content Bias, Emotional Load Score, Doomscroll Index, Cognitive Diversity Score, and Mindfulness Gap Score.

### Content Wellness Tracker  
A focused awareness tool that tracks content consumption patterns, detects information overload and negative content bias, and provides gentle interventions to promote mindful browsing habits.

## Core Principles

- **Privacy First**: All data processing follows privacy-by-design principles with minimal data collection and user control
- **Awareness Over Restriction**: Focus on providing insights and gentle guidance rather than blocking or restricting access
- **Evidence-Based**: Uses established metrics from sentiment analysis and digital wellbeing research
- **Non-Judgmental**: Presents data and insights without clinical judgments or shame-based messaging

## Target Users

Users who want to develop a healthier relationship with digital content consumption, understand their browsing patterns' emotional impact, and make more mindful choices about their information diet.
